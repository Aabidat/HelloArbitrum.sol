1.I opened Remix IDE and and I navigated to the file eplorer on the interface and created folder named "Arbitrum deployment" to get a new work space. In the folder I created a solidity file also called "storagefactory. sol" to wrte my smart contract there. 2.I started writing my smart contract by adding a licence identifier and then wrote the compiler directive version which will be used to compile my code. After that I defined my contract as "contract simplestorage"i stated a variable uint256 favoriteNumber and made it public for others have access to it.

Compiling my contract
I selected the solidity compiler from the sidebar and I made sure that the compiler version matches the one specicified in my solidity file and I clicked on compile i saw a green checkmark on the solidity compiler which indicates that it was nothing wrong with my smart contract.

Deploying my contract
I navigated to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab and clicked on deploy I tested the contact by entering values into the contract funstions and observed it's response.
